## 0.5.0 - 2018-05-23

### Added

- [#28](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication/pull/28) adds the final class `DefaultUser`, which provides an immutable version of `UserInterface`
  that can be used in most situations.

- [#28](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication/pull/28) adds the service factory `DefaultUserFactory`, which returns a PHP `callable`
  capable of producing a `DefaultUser` instance from the provided `$identity`,
  `$roles`, and `$details` arguments.

### Changed

- [#28](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication/pull/28) updates the `PdoDatabase` user repository to accept an additional
  configuration item, `sql_get_details`. This value should be a SQL statement
  that may be used to retrieve additional user details to provide in the
  `UserInterface` instance returned by the repository on successful
  authentication.

- [#28](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication/pull/28) updates `UserRepositoryInterface` to remove the method `getRolesFromUser()`;
  this method is not needed, as `UserInterface` already provides access to user roles.

- [#28](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication/pull/28) modifies each of the `Htpasswd` and `PdoDatabase` user repository
  implementations to accept a new constructor argument, a callable
  `$userFactory`. This factory should implement the following signature:

  ```php
  function (string $identity, array $roles = [], array $details = []) : UserInterface
  ```

  This factory will be called by the repository in order to produce a
  `UserInterface` instance on successful authentication. You may provide the
  factory via the service `Zend\Expressive\Authentication\UserInterface` if you
  wish to use one other than the one returned by the provided
  `DefaultUserFactory` class.

- [#28](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication/pull/28) modifies `UserInterface` as follows:
  - Renames `getUserRoles()` to `getRoles()`
  - Adds `getDetail(string $name, mixed $default)`
  - Adds `getDetails() : array`

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- [#28](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication/pull/28) removes `UserTrait` in favor of the `DefaultUser` implementation.

### Fixed

- Nothing.

## 0.4.0 - 2018-03-15

### Added

- [#15](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication/pull/15)
  adds support for PSR-15.

### Changed

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- [#15](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication/pull/15) and
  [#3](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication/pull/3)
  remove support for http-interop/http-middleware and
  http-interop/http-server-middleware.

- [#19](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication/pull/19)
  removes `Zend\Expressive\Authentication\ResponsePrototypeTrait`; the approach
  was flawed, and the various adapters will be updated to compose response
  factories instead of instances.

### Fixed

- [#18](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication/pull/18)
  uses the `ResponseInterface` as a factory. This was recently changed in
  [zend-expressive#561](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive/pull/561).

## 0.3.1 - 2018-03-12

### Added

- Nothing.

### Changed

- [#22](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication/issues/22)
  updates the `ResponsePrototypeTrait` to allow callable `ResponseInterface`
  services (instead of those directly returning a `ResponseInterface`).

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- Nothing.

## 0.3.0 - 2018-01-24

### Added

- Nothing.

### Changed

- [#14](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication/issues/14)

  `UserInterface::getIdentity()`.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#13](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication/pull/13)
  fixes an issue whereby fetching a record by an unknown username resulted in a
  "Trying to get property of non-object" error when using the `PdoDatabase` user
  repository implementation.

## 0.2.0 - 2017-11-27

### Added

- Nothing.

### Changed

- [#4](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication/pull/4)

  role names.

- [#4](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication/pull/4)
  renames the method `UserRepositoryInterface::getRoleFromUser()` to
  `UserRepositoryInterface::getRolesFromUser()`. The method MUST return an array
  of string role names.
